# SafariSplitScreen
Super-basic Xcode 7 project that uses `SFSafariViewController` so that you can have a splitscreen browsing experience on supported multitasking devices.  This app is for entertainment purposes only and shouldn't be considered a serious app.

## Limitations

`SFSafariViewController` does not allow the user to change the URL, so I default the URL to google.com.  Even doing a search in Google with a URL will invariably give a link to that page, anyway.
